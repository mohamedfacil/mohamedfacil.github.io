	<p>Biryani is the primary dish in a meal, while the pulao is usually a secondary accompaniment to a larger meal
In biryani, meat and rice are cooked separately before being layered and cooked together. Pulao is a single-pot dish: meat and rice are simmered in a liquid until the liquid is absorbed. However, some other writers, such as Holly Shaffer (based on her observations in Lucknow), R. K. Saxena and Sangeeta Bhatnagar have reported pulao recipes in which the rice and meat are cooked separately and then mixed before the dum cooking.[17][20]
Biryanis have more complex and stronger spices compared to pulao. The British-era author Abdul Halim Sharar mentions this as their primary difference: biryani has a stronger taste of curried rice due to a greater amount of spices.[17][21]</p>
