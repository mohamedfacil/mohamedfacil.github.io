	<p>If you know anything about me, you know that I am a sucker for quick and easy weeknight meals. As a full-time working woman, these type of meals are a life-saver. But luckily, quick and easy does not have to mean bland and boring. One pot Spanish chicken and rice is packed with flavour, real ingredients and is full of vibrant colours that will make your heart sing.
It’s quick because it only takes about 30 minutes to cook. It’s easy because everything cooks in one single pot (or skillet). That’s right…. this is a no fuss, no clean up dinner. From cutting board to pot to plate.
And while you have all your ingredients tossed together in your skillet, you simply cover and let it cook on its own for 25 minutes. You don’t have to monitor a thing. You don’t even have to use this time to prepare side dishes because this dish, my friend, is an all-round wholesome and balanced meal. It’s got your protein, it’s got your grains, its got your veggies.

The only thing that will be happening in your home is you sitting down, kicking your feet up while your mouth starts salivating from the amazing aromas that will be filling up your kitchen.</p>
